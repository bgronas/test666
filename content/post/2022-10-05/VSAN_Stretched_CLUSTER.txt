VSAN Stretch clusters
i samme vCenter (DC1, DC2, Witness)

1-15 hosts on each DC1/2
All 15 hosts = one fault domain, Fault domain 1 and 2
Fault Domain 3 == witness
RTT==5ms between the two DCs
Witness= RTT <200ms

Typisk Conf.  
- Primary Failure to tolerate
FTT = 1, Raid1
	dvs. Skriv på DC1 og DC2
ACK ved skriv på DC2, means RPO=0



- Secondary Failure to tolerate
- Lokalt for DC2
FTT = 1, Raid 1
FTT = 1, Erasure Coding (5/6)
eller 
FTT = 2, Raid 1
FTT = 2, Erasure Coding (5/6)

all vSAN objects and their corresponding policies? Maybe with PowerCLI or vROPs?

Hi all , there is any way for monitor (maybe with vrops) the vSAN LLOG consumption, PLOG consumption,Total log consumption ?

Customer feels that the latency can be improved or the amount of IOPS?
Customer is experiencing high latency on all applications or only some of them?
Does our metrics on vCenter or vROPs shows that the vSAN latency is high or VMs disk latency is high?
What's the vSAN's version on customer today? We generally implement performance improvement on most recent versions.
How is the vSAN Health (or Skyline Health). Drivers, Firmwares are on the recommended version?
Is vSAN Health showing any alert Yellow or Red?
Are the vSphere + vSAN network configured according with the best practices (vmkernel, shares, etc)?
Any signal of problemes on the Network? High number of collisions or tranmission errors?
It's an Hybrid or Flash Environment?
Disk Groups and Cache are correctly sized and according with the best practices?
There is sufficient resources (memory and CPU) available on the environment?
There is sufficient free space on the vSAN DataStore?
What are the policies applied?


You should only look at Host -> Monitor -> vSAN -> Performance
