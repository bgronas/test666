##### For the fourth time I am a 'captain' as a part of the VMware Hands-On Labs, and this year I will be on both **VMware Explore** arrangements in USA and EUROPE. 

###### While serving the Hands-on Labs environment, we will have Instructor Lead Workshops (ELW) where the participating audience will have headsets and listening to me while we go through one of the labs. 

###### One of the Labs I've previously have written is the Advanced Topics in vRealize Log Insight (HOL-2201-11-CMP), and this particular Instructor Lead Workshops will be taken from one of the modules from that Lab. 

With me will be my CO-Host: Staff Technical Account Manager at VMware, **Shannon Fitzpatrick**
