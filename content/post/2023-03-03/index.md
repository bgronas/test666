# Dead or alive?  

Is the good old Pathfinder dead and Modern Apps and Cloud Management **Techzone** next? Maybe, or maybe it isn’t



 

## What am I talking about?

For some time, VMware have had a collection of resources assembled as a collection in a one-stop-shop for resources such as videos, blogs, articles and training for all the cloud management products. Even the [Hands-On Labs](https://labs.hol.vmware.com/) have had links on these pages. This collection was called [PathFinder](https://pathfinder.vmware.com.)  

Now there has emerged another good one, that will more or less take over the whole she-bang, called [TechZone](https://apps-cloudmgmt.techzone.vmware.com/).
