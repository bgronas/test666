            Frigate Frigate - I&#39;ve neither seen the boat nor the bird but my Frigate can actually dock or nest?! :-) Frigate is an open source NVR, a Network Video Recorder which is run as a Docker container on a Docker host. My preferred choice was to run it on Ubuntu 21.04 and install all the docker components directly on ubuntu on hardware. This is the recommended install method.
I hope that, by exposing my own configuration here, people might install and configure frigate faster than I did.

            How I mistakenly did the Google integration I noticed that Alexa was super responsive to my &amp;quot;turn off kitchen table&amp;quot; messages, but my Google were so slow. One day my little Google home mini just referenced me to some Nabu Casa stuff, and I suddenly realized &amp;quot;Hey, We&#39;re going through the web for this!!&amp;quot; = crap!
 Previously I had just incorporated Google under: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/cloud/account and It works, but it&#39;s not what I want!
