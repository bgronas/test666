            WOW, I just moved to HUGO. Wordpress I was previously using Wordpress with my public web provider. proISP. I have loved ProISP, they are providing me with domains, e-mail, web hosting, MySQL databases and everything.
Hosting a Wordpress site with them and paying almost nothing for it was very cool, and I have loved wordpress for the simplicity and for the easiness of changing the looks by using simple CSS, Templates, and publishing, It&#39;s just been a walk in the park.
