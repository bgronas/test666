      <title>Root Password Expiration on VRealize Appliances [23.06.2022]</title>

            What&#39;s the problem? Normally a Virtual appliance (VA) in the vRealize Suite (VRS), will expire the root password you set under the installation in a year. Well, nothing dramatic about that. But, will you remember to change it next year? Maybe, if something told you in a GUI, mail or monitoring system that the password were going to expire.
A monitoring dilemma When the VA root password is expired it will prompt you to change it when you SSH into it.

            How I mistakenly did the Google integration I noticed that Alexa was super responsive to my &amp;quot;turn off kitchen table&amp;quot; messages, but my Google were so slow. One day my little Google home mini just referenced me to some Nabu Casa stuff, and I suddenly realized &amp;quot;Hey, We&#39;re going through the web for this!!&amp;quot; = crap!
 Previously I had just incorporated Google under: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/cloud/account and It works, but it&#39;s not what I want!
