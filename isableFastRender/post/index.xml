            For the fourth time I am a &#39;captain&#39; as a part of the VMware Hands-On Labs, and this year I will be on both VMware Explore arrangements in USA and EUROPE. While serving the Hands-on Labs environment, we will have Instructor Lead Workshops (ELW) where the participating audience will have headsets and listening to me while we go through one of the labs. One of the Labs I&#39;ve previously have written is the Advanced Topics in vRealize Log Insight (HOL-2201-11-CMP), and this particular Instructor Lead Workshops will be taken from one of the modules from that Lab.

      <title>Root Password Expiration on VRealize Appliances [23.06.2022]</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/2022-06-23/</link>

            What&#39;s the problem? Normally a Virtual appliance (VA) in the vRealize Suite (VRS), will expire the root password you set under the installation in a year. Well, nothing dramatic about that. But, will you remember to change it next year? Maybe, if something told you in a GUI, mail or monitoring system that the password were going to expire.
A monitoring dilemma When the VA root password is expired it will prompt you to change it when you SSH into it.

            VMware Explore is the new VMworld Right? Right! Yes it&#39;s all here, this will not change back again. Do we all want to change in the same pace VMware does. We all know that can be challenging for customers, but what about you? Read through this and see if your own personal opinions differ from mine, I hope they do.
Being a VMware employee VMware is all about diversity. We can all be ourselves as long as we don&#39;t hurt anyone.

            Recently, VMware released new and improved vRealize versions. Let&#39;s have a look on vRealize Operations and the new v8.6.3 of the product.
This release from 8.6.2 to 8.6.3. is a is a maintenance release which resolves a few important security and functionality issues identified in the product For more details, see KB 88081. There are 154 CVE&#39;s (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) solved and fixed. I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite a large update even if it feels minor.

            Frigate Frigate - I&#39;ve neither seen the boat nor the bird but my Frigate can actually dock or nest?! :-) Frigate is an open source NVR, a Network Video Recorder which is run as a Docker container on a Docker host. My preferred choice was to run it on Ubuntu 21.04 and install all the docker components directly on ubuntu on hardware. This is the recommended install method.
I hope that, by exposing my own configuration here, people might install and configure frigate faster than I did.

            How I mistakenly did the Google integration I noticed that Alexa was super responsive to my &amp;quot;turn off kitchen table&amp;quot; messages, but my Google were so slow. One day my little Google home mini just referenced me to some Nabu Casa stuff, and I suddenly realized &amp;quot;Hey, We&#39;re going through the web for this!!&amp;quot; = crap!
 Previously I had just incorporated Google under: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/cloud/account and It works, but it&#39;s not what I want!

            WOW, I just moved to HUGO. Wordpress I was previously using Wordpress with my public web provider. proISP. I have loved ProISP, they are providing me with domains, e-mail, web hosting, MySQL databases and everything.
Hosting a Wordpress site with them and paying almost nothing for it was very cool, and I have loved wordpress for the simplicity and for the easiness of changing the looks by using simple CSS, Templates, and publishing, It&#39;s just been a walk in the park.

            Extending vRealize Operations with vRealize Orchestrator
Sometimes it&#39;s a good thing to connect vRealize Orchestrator to vRealize Operations to be able to do actions and remedies based on alerts in vRealize Operations. Another thing that this connection provides is the possibilities to run Orchestrator workflows directly from vRealize Operations objects.
How we do this - in details, now! Prerequisites
You will need:
 vRealize Orchestrator installed This can either be included together with vRealize Automation, or, a standalone Orchestrator solution.

      <title>Mixing VRealize Operations Licenses</title>

            Mixing vRealize Operations Licenses isn&#39;t easy. Let&#39;s try to define what&#39;s possible. Mixing vRealize Suite / vRealize Operations Licenses.  The vRealize Suite STD will give you vROps ADV With both suites (adv/std) you will end up with vROps Adv. You can mix vROps ADV and vROps ENT editions/licenses. You can&#39;t mix vROps STD with vROps ADV or vROps Ent. vRealize Suite Per-CPU and per OSI can be mixed vRealize Operations ADV + vRealize Suite STD - This allowed but ONLY as separate license groups.
