            Recently, VMware released new and improved vRealize versions. Let&#39;s have a look on vRealize Operations and the new v8.6.3 of the product.
This release from 8.6.2 to 8.6.3. is a is a maintenance release which resolves a few important security and functionality issues identified in the product For more details, see KB 88081. There are 154 CVE&#39;s (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) solved and fixed. I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite a large update even if it feels minor.
