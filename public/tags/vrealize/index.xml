            What&#39;s the problem? Normally a Virtual appliance (VA) in the vRealize Suite (VRS), will expire the root password you set under the installation in a year. Well, nothing dramatic about that. But, will you remember to change it next year? Maybe, if something told you in a GUI, mail or monitoring system that the password were going to expire.
A monitoring dilemma When the VA root password is expired it will prompt you to change it when you SSH into it.

            Recently, VMware released new and improved vRealize versions. Let&#39;s have a look on vRealize Operations and the new v8.6.3 of the product.
This release from 8.6.2 to 8.6.3. is a is a maintenance release which resolves a few important security and functionality issues identified in the product For more details, see KB 88081. There are 154 CVE&#39;s (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) solved and fixed. I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite a large update even if it feels minor.

            Mixing vRealize Operations Licenses isn&#39;t easy. Let&#39;s try to define what&#39;s possible. Mixing vRealize Suite / vRealize Operations Licenses.  The vRealize Suite STD will give you vROps ADV With both suites (adv/std) you will end up with vROps Adv. You can mix vROps ADV and vROps ENT editions/licenses. You can&#39;t mix vROps STD with vROps ADV or vROps Ent. vRealize Suite Per-CPU and per OSI can be mixed vRealize Operations ADV + vRealize Suite STD - This allowed but ONLY as separate license groups.
