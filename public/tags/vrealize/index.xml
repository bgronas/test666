            What if you are Unable to bring your vRealize (Aria) Operations cluster online because one or more nodes are out of disk space. Let&#39;s see if the log disk is the problem and try to fix it
The goal is to find out if the Log disk is full and how to clean it and hopefully you save some time with this mini-Recipe that will show you how to investigate the &amp;quot;Unable to bring the cluster online because one or more nodes are out of disk space.

            For the fourth time I am a &#39;captain&#39; as a part of the VMware Hands-On Labs, and this year I will be on both VMware Explore arrangements in USA and EUROPE. While serving the Hands-on Labs environment, we will have Instructor Lead Workshops (ELW) where the participating audience will have headsets and listening to me while we go through one of the labs. One of the Labs I&#39;ve previously have written is the Advanced Topics in vRealize Log Insight (HOL-2201-11-CMP), and this particular Instructor Lead Workshops will be taken from one of the modules from that Lab.

      <title>Root Password Expiration on VRealize Appliances [23.06.2022]</title>

            What&#39;s the problem? Normally a Virtual appliance (VA) in the vRealize Suite (VRS), will expire the root password you set under the installation in a year. Well, nothing dramatic about that. But, will you remember to change it next year? Maybe, if something told you in a GUI, mail or monitoring system that the password were going to expire.
A monitoring dilemma When the VA root password is expired it will prompt you to change it when you SSH into it.

            Recently, VMware released new and improved vRealize versions. Let&#39;s have a look on vRealize Operations and the new v8.6.3 of the product.
This release from 8.6.2 to 8.6.3. is a is a maintenance release which resolves a few important security and functionality issues identified in the product For more details, see KB 88081. There are 154 CVE&#39;s (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) solved and fixed. I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite a large update even if it feels minor.

            Mixing vRealize Operations Licenses isn&#39;t easy. Let&#39;s try to define what&#39;s possible. Mixing vRealize Suite / vRealize Operations Licenses.  The vRealize Suite STD will give you vROps ADV With both suites (adv/std) you will end up with vROps Adv. You can mix vROps ADV and vROps ENT editions/licenses. You can&#39;t mix vROps STD with vROps ADV or vROps Ent. vRealize Suite Per-CPU and per OSI can be mixed vRealize Operations ADV + vRealize Suite STD - This allowed but ONLY as separate license groups.
