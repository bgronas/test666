Frigate Frigate - I've neither seen the boat nor the bird but my Frigate can actually dock or nest?! :-) Frigate is an open source NVR, a Network Video Recorder which is run as a Docker container on a Docker host. My preferred choice was to run it on Ubuntu 21.04 and install all the docker components directly on ubuntu on hardware. This is the recommended install method.
I hope that, by exposing my own configuration here, people might install and configure frigate faster than I did.</description></item></channel></rss>
