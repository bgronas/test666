            Frigate Frigate - I&#39;ve neither seen the boat nor the bird but my Frigate can actually dock or nest?! :-) Frigate is an open source NVR, a Network Video Recorder which is run as a Docker container on a Docker host. My preferred choice was to run it on Ubuntu 21.04 and install all the docker components directly on ubuntu on hardware. This is the recommended install method.
I hope that, by exposing my own configuration here, people might install and configure frigate faster than I did.

            WOW, I just moved to HUGO. Wordpress I was previously using Wordpress with my public web provider. proISP. I have loved ProISP, they are providing me with domains, e-mail, web hosting, MySQL databases and everything.
Hosting a Wordpress site with them and paying almost nothing for it was very cool, and I have loved wordpress for the simplicity and for the easiness of changing the looks by using simple CSS, Templates, and publishing, It&#39;s just been a walk in the park.

            Mixing vRealize Operations Licenses isn&#39;t easy. Let&#39;s try to define what&#39;s possible. Mixing vRealize Suite / vRealize Operations Licenses.  The vRealize Suite STD will give you vROps ADV With both suites (adv/std) you will end up with vROps Adv. You can mix vROps ADV and vROps ENT editions/licenses. You can&#39;t mix vROps STD with vROps ADV or vROps Ent. vRealize Suite Per-CPU and per OSI can be mixed vRealize Operations ADV + vRealize Suite STD - This allowed but ONLY as separate license groups.
