What's the problem? Normally a Virtual appliance (VA) in the vRealize Suite (VRS), will expire the root password you set under the installation in a year. Well, nothing dramatic about that. But, will you remember to change it next year? Maybe, if something told you in a GUI, mail or monitoring system that the password were going to expire.
