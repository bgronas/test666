            How-to set up Python on Pi The goal of this little article is to show how I installed Python on raspberry PI. There are lot&#39;s of articles out there on the subject, but since I am a beginner, I am running through everything I find useful for my self and as a later notice to myself. This saves med the time and hassle to find the recipe or how-to next time.

            What&#39;s the problem? Normally a Virtual appliance (VA) in the vRealize Suite (VRS), will expire the root password you set under the installation in a year. Well, nothing dramatic about that. But, will you remember to change it next year? Maybe, if something told you in a GUI, mail or monitoring system that the password were going to expire.
A monitoring dilemma When the VA root password is expired it will prompt you to change it when you SSH into it.
