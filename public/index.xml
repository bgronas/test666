            VMware Explore is the new VMworld Right? Right! Yes it&#39;s all here, this will not change back again. Do we all want to change in the same pace VMware does. We all know that can be challenging for customers, but what about you? Read through this and see if your own personal opinions differ from mine, I hope they do.
Can I slag off VMware even if I&#39;m an employee Yes, I think I can.

            Recently, VMware released new and improved vRealize versions. Let&#39;s have a look on vRealize Operations and the new v8.6.3 of the product.
This release from 8.6.2 to 8.6.3. is a is a maintenance release which resolves a few important security and functionality issues identified in the product For more details, see KB 88081. There are 154 CVE&#39;s (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) solved and fixed. I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite a large update even if it feels minor.

      <title>Frigate - I&#39;ve neither seen the boat nor the bird</title>

            Frigate Frigate - I&#39;ve neither seen the boat nor the bird but my Frigate can actually dock or nest?! :-) Frigate is an open source NVR, a Network Video Recorder which is run as a Docker container on a Docker host. My preferred choice was to run it on Ubuntu 21.04 and install all the docker components directly on ubuntu on hardware. This is the recommended install method.
I hope that, by exposing my own configuration here, people might install and configure frigate faster than I did.

            WOW, I just moved to HUGO. Wordpress I was previously using Wordpress with my public web provider. proISP. I have loved ProISP, they are providing me with domains, e-mail, web hosting, MySQL databases and everything.
Hosting a Wordpress site with them and paying almost nothing for it was very cool, and I have loved wordpress for the simplicity and for the easiness of changing the looks by using simple CSS, Templates, and publishing, It&#39;s just been a walk in the park.

      <title>Mixing VRealize Operations Licenses</title>

            Mixing vRealize Operations Licenses isn&#39;t easy. Let&#39;s try to define what&#39;s possible. Mixing vRealize Suite / vRealize Operations Licenses.  The vRealize Suite STD will give you vROps ADV With both suites (adv/std) you will end up with vROps Adv. You can mix vROps ADV and vROps ENT editions/licenses. You can&#39;t mix vROps STD with vROps ADV or vROps Ent. vRealize Suite Per-CPU and per OSI can be mixed vRealize Operations ADV + vRealize Suite STD - This allowed but ONLY as separate license groups.
