The goal and purpose of this article is to show the implementation of known technologu to accomplish the Powering off of VMs in on a regular schedule in the infrastructure the same way Google GCP, AWS, and Azure VMs does it with their Hyperscalers.
This article is divided into Two parts:
IaaS Automated Powersaving, Green Sustainability - Pt.1 IaaS Automated Powersaving, Green Sustainability - Pt.2
This is the second article containing the practical walk through of an example of how to do this with VMware technology.</description></item><item><title>IaaS Automated Powersaving, Green Sustainability - Pt.1</title><link>/post/2023-03-27/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 17:43:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>/post/2023-03-27/</guid><description>
The goal and purpose of this article is to discuss “the WHY” in Powering off and Powering On VMs based on regular Schedule, just the way Google GCP, AWS, and Azure does it with VMs. Why would we implement Sustainable Practices to meet our sustainability goals?

Objectives The goal and purpose is to show how to connect vRealize Orchestrator to vRealize Operations to later be able to do actions and remedies based on alerts in vRealize Operations. You can then also run Orchestrator workflows directly from vRealize Operations objects. I hope this little article with it’s two cruicial tips will save you time and hassle and to easily be successful.
Prerequisites vRealize Orchestrator installed. My Orchestrator is installed with vRealize Automation or you can download your standalone version from Customer Connect Look under &amp;quot;Download VMware vSphere&amp;quot; (vRO is free with vCenter).</description></item><item><title>VROPS Out of Disk Space</title><link>/post/2023-01-31/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 12:53:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>/post/2023-01-31/</guid><description>
What if you are Unable to bring your vRealize (Aria) Operations cluster online because one or more nodes are out of disk space. Let's see if the log disk is the problem and try to fix it
The goal is to find out if the Log disk is full and how to clean it and hopefully you save some time with this mini-Recipe that will show you how to investigate the &amp;quot;Unable to bring the cluster online because one or more nodes are out of disk space.</description></item><item><title>Bypass Windows 11 Install Problems</title><link>/post/2022-12-10/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 15:22:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>/post/2022-12-10/</guid><description>
The problem The goal and purpose was that I needed to bypass the &amp;quot;This PC can’t run Windows 11&amp;quot; problem during an installation of a Windows 11 Virtual Machine (VM) in my test environment. This DIY recipe will save us the hassle of googling it once again and sorting out the correct article to try out.
This PC can’t run Windows 11 This happens during an install:
The Solution Go back one step by clicking top-left blue arrow press 'Shift+F10' in the CMD box, type 'regedit' and press enter in the registry editor Navigate to “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup” Right click Setup, Choose New Key, and Name it &amp;quot;LabConfig&amp;quot; Under LabConfig, add all these values as DWORD (32-bit) Values and set the data to 1 BypassCPUCheck BypassRAMCheck BypassSecureBootCheck BypassStorageCheck BypassTPMCheck After all these manual inserrtions are done, you are ready to continue the fight of installing Windows 11.</description></item><item><title>VRealize Operations Management Pack for Kubernetes 1.8 [15.11.2022]</title><link>/post/2022-11-15/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 17:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>/post/2022-11-15/</guid><description>
Monitoring K8s with VMware Monitoring is an essential part of DevOps. As enterprises are using Kubernetes, they would need all the capabilities they leverage today for virtual machines. Starting from discovering the Kubernetes clusters, creating an inventory, defining relationships, and finally collecting all the key metrics and events to provide full visibility and do Troubleshooting and Root Cause Analysis.
You can use vRealize Operations to monitor your open-source container orchestration system Kubernetes environment.</description></item><item><title>Install Python 3.10.8 on RaspBerry PI [18.10.2022]</title><link>/post/2022-10-18/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:49:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>/post/2022-10-18/</guid><description>

For the fourth time I am a 'captain' as a part of the VMware Hands-On Labs, and this year I will be on both VMware Explore arrangements in USA and EUROPE. While serving the Hands-on Labs environment, we will have Instructor Lead Workshops (ELW) where the participating audience will have headsets and listening to me while we go through one of the labs. One of the Labs I've previously have written is the Advanced Topics in vRealize Log Insight (HOL-2201-11-CMP), and this particular Instructor Lead Workshops will be taken from one of the modules from that Lab.</description></item><item><title>Root Password Expiration on VRealize Appliances [23.06.2022]</title><link>/post/2022-06-23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 11:03:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/post/2022-06-23/</guid><description>
What's the problem? Normally a Virtual appliance (VA) in the vRealize Suite (VRS), will expire the root password you set under the installation in a year. Well, nothing dramatic about that. But, will you remember to change it next year? Maybe, if something told you in a GUI, mail or monitoring system that the password were going to expire.
A monitoring dilemma When the VA root password is expired it will prompt you to change it when you SSH into it.</description></item><item><title>VMware Explore, the New VMworld!

VMware Explore is the new VMworld Right? Right! Yes it's all here, this will not change back again. Do we all want to change in the same pace VMware does. We all know that can be challenging for customers, but what about you? Read through this and see if your own personal opinions differ from mine, I hope they do.
Being a VMware employee VMware is all about diversity. We can all be ourselves as long as we don't hurt anyone.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Operations 8.6.3.

Recently, VMware released new and improved vRealize versions. Let's have a look on vRealize Operations and the new v8.6.3 of the product.
This release from 8.6.2 to 8.6.3. is a is a maintenance release which resolves a few important security and functionality issues identified in the product For more details, see KB 88081. There are 154 CVE's (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) solved and fixed. I'd say it's quite a large update even if it feels minor.</description></item><item><title>Frigate - I've neither seen the boat nor the bird</title><link>/post/2022-03-07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 20:31:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2022-03-07/</guid><description>
Frigate Frigate - I've neither seen the boat nor the bird but my Frigate can actually dock or nest?! :-) Frigate is an open source NVR, a Network Video Recorder which is run as a Docker container on a Docker host. My preferred choice was to run it on Ubuntu 21.04 and install all the docker components directly on ubuntu on hardware. This is the recommended install method.
I hope that, by exposing my own configuration here, people might install and configure frigate faster than I did.</description></item><item><title>New Year, New Blog, Learning HUGO [19.01.2022]</title><link>/post/year-blog-learning-hugo-19-01-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 15:55:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/year-blog-learning-hugo-19-01-2022/</guid><description>
WOW, I just moved to HUGO. Wordpress I was previously using Wordpress with my public web provider. proISP. I have loved ProISP, they are providing me with domains, e-mail, web hosting, MySQL databases and everything.
Hosting a Wordpress site with them and paying almost nothing for it was very cool, and I have loved wordpress for the simplicity and for the easiness of changing the looks by using simple CSS, Templates, and publishing, It's just been a walk in the park.</description></item><item><title>Mixing VRealize Operations Licenses</title><link>/post/2022-01-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 01:29:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>/post/2022-01-11/</guid><description>
Mixing vRealize Operations Licenses isn't easy. Let's try to define what's possible. Mixing vRealize Suite / vRealize Operations Licenses. The vRealize Suite STD will give you vROps ADV With both suites (adv/std) you will end up with vROps Adv. You can mix vROps ADV and vROps ENT editions/licenses. You can't mix vROps STD with vROps ADV or vROps Ent. vRealize Suite Per-CPU and per OSI can be mixed vRealize Operations ADV + vRealize Suite STD - This allowed but ONLY as separate license groups.</description></item></channel></rss>
